<h4>Parallel Implementations of Scientific Libraries on Sage</h4>
<p>This project is trying to implement parallel versions of some well-known scientific libraries - GNU Scientific Library, BLAS, LAPACK on Sage (http://www.sagemath.org/).</p>

<h4>Phase 1: stats/</h4>
<ul>
<li>1st moment - mean</li>
<li>2nd moment and co-moment - variance, covariance and correlation</li>
<li>Higher moments - skewness and kurtosis</li>
</ul>
